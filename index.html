                    Orangutan Guardian is a user-friendly app dedicated to the preservation of orangutans by facilitating tree planting in their natural habitat in Indonesia. Orangutans live in the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra, where deforestation poses a significant threat to their survival. 
                    By using Orangutan Guardian, users can contribute to reforestation efforts that restore these critical habitats, providing food and shelter for orangutans and other wildlife.

                    <br>
                    The app offers information on the specific trees being planted and their environmental impact, such as improving air quality, preventing soil erosion, and supporting biodiversity. Users can track their contributions, see the growth of the trees they've helped plant, and learn about the positive changes their efforts are making in the ecosystem. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Orangutan Guardian empowers individuals to make a real difference in preserving these majestic creatures and their environment.
